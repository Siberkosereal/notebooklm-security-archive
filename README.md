# Cybersecurity Research Corpus for NotebookLM

This repository contains a curated collection of cybersecurity resources, including industry reports, technical articles, and threat intelligence data. The primary objective is to provide a structured dataset for deep analysis and synthesis using **Gemini NotebookLM**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal is to consolidate disparate security documents—ranging from vulnerability research to network defense strategies—into a machine-readable format to leverage AI-driven insights, summarization, and cross-referencing.

🛠️ Data Processing & Tooling
To prepare these resources for Gemini NotebookLM, I utilized two custom Python tools I developed for content optimization:
HTML to MD Converter: Used to strip unnecessary HTML tags and convert web-based resources into clean, structured Markdown for better AI comprehension.
MD to HTML Converter: Used to generate web-compatible versions of the research notes while maintaining structural integrity.
These tools ensured that the disparate sources were unified into a consistent, machine-readable format.

## 📁 Content Overview
* **Formats:** Cleaned Markdown (.md) and HTML files.
* **Topics:** Threat Intelligence, Network Security, Digital Forensics, and SecOps.
* **Optimization:** Documents are formatted to maintain structural integrity during AI ingestion.
